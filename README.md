# PPPwnUI
PPPwnUI is a Python/TK GUI for installing the GoldHen homebrew tool for the PS4 [PPPwn](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn/) created by [TheFlow](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/).

goldhen enables you to install homebrew PS4 software onto the PS4's hard drive and copy files to and from it via FTP amongst other handy features.

## Hardware requirements

PPPwn UI requires an ethernet port and cable to connect your computer to the PS4.

You must be running PS4 firmware v11.00. Unfortunately this exploit does not curently work under later firmware revisions.


## Installation :

- Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/B-Dem/PPPwnUI
```

- Install the requirements:

Under Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distros run:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-scapy python3-tk
```

# Network configuration

Your ethernet port must be configured to use the **shared to other computers** method before you run PPPwnUI.

You can configure this under Linux using the NetworkManager GUI by opening your wired connection's settings window, switch to the **IPv4 settings** tab then click the **Method** drop down menu and change the **Method** confguration option to use **shared to other computers**.

## Copy goldhen.bin to a USB disk

On your computer:

- Copy `goldhen.bin` from the **USB Drive (GoldHEN_vX.XXX)** directory of this repo to the root directory of an exfat/fat32 USB and insert it into your PS4.

## Usage :

- Launch the app with

  **Windows :**
  
  ```PPPwnUI.bat```

  **Linux :**

  ```sh
  sudo python3 PPPwnUI.py
  ```

**PPPwnUI must be run either using sudo or as the root user**

- Select your Interface using the drop-down menu. Under Linux this will usually be eth0.

## Connecting to PPPwn from your PS4

After configuring your ethernet interface, copying goldhen.bin onto USB, connecting an ethernet cable to your PS4 and starting PPPwn you do the following on your PS4:

- Go to **Settings**` and then **Network**
- Select **Set Up Internet connection** and choose **Use a LAN Cable**
- Choose **Custom setup** and choose **PPPoE** for **IP Address Settings**
- Enter anything for **PPPoE User ID** and **PPPoE Pasword**
- Choose **Automatic** for **DNS Settings** and **MTU Settings**
- Choose **Do Not Use** for **Proxy Server**
- Click **Test Internet Connection** to connect to PPwnUI

If the exploit fails or the PS4 crashes, you can skip the internet setup and simply click on `Test Internet Connection`. If the script fail or is stuck waiting for a request/response, abort it and run it again on your computer, and then click on `Test Internet Connection` on your PS4.
